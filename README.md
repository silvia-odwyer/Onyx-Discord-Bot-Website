Onyx has her very own home on the Internet now, and all updates to commands tables, features, and more will be posted on this website,
as well as on her GitHub README file.

It includes some notable pages, which may be of important to those who wish to add Onyx to their Discord server.

## Scrolling Animations
Scrolling animations are using the amazing ScrollMagic.js library, in case you're wondering! Creating scroll animations
with this library was such a great experience, and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to add some dynamic animation to their website.

## Onyx LABS
This is the experimental division, containing some new features that Onyx may have in the future. It has a slightly different 
UI to the rest of the website, in order to enhance its experimental feel.

## Contributors
